# Learning Phaser 3
[Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) is an open source HTML5 game framework that I've been wanting to learn for some time now. I've been having trouble getting started with the framework so I purchased the [HTML5 Game Development Mini-Degree](https://academy.zenva.com/product/html5-game-phaser-mini-degree/) course from the people at Zenva Academy to help speed up my learning and give me a solid foundation to work from. This repository is the result of my time going through their courses.

Try and steal as much treasure as you can while avoiding dragons by holding down the left mouse button, or touch the screen, to move your character across the screen.
